## R Markdown

Descrive the purpose of this report or someting....

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

## Variation
*Chart
```{r USAccDeaths,echo=FALSE}
show(USAccDeaths)
```
*Range
```{r USAccDeaths,echo=FALSE}
range(USAccDeaths)
```
*Quartiles
```{r USAccDeaths,echo=FALSE}
summary(USAccDeaths)
```

*Boxplots
```{r echo=FALSE}
boxplot(USAccDeaths, main ='Number of Death')
```


## Plot and Histogram
According to the plot, the number of death was maxumum on Jul in every year.

```{r USAccDeath,echo=FALSE}
plot(USAccDeaths, ylab = 'Number of Death')
hist(USAccDeaths, main = 'Accidental Deaths in the US 1973â€“1978', xlab = 'number of death')
```




Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
