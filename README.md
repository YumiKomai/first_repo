# First Assignment
---
This first pair assignment has been done by *Yumi Komai* and *Pol Santaló*. 
The contribution of every student it has been equal and it can be described as follows: 
First of all, we created a Repository in our desktop through the program GitHub. 
At the same time, we made each other contributors so we could share and edit the documents
that we posted in our Repository folder and in GitHub. In order to create the R source code
files document that access at least two data sets, we created a Markdown document where we
entered the the code 'plot' plus the name of the dates sets that we were interested to show.
Then we covert it in a HTML document and we shared it in our repository. 

We also posted it in our GitHub online account through the GitHub program in our computer
in order to have it there posted and make some changes online if needed. The pair that 
helped us to finish with the last point of the assignment are Bomi and Takuma. 
They made a pull request and our document was minutely discussed and merged. 

We used USAccDeaths,UKDriverDeaths and some other datasets.
